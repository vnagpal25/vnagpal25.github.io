    <h1>Water Quality Assesment Chatbot</h1>
    <li>Source Code: </li>
    <li><a href=""></a>Web Application Chatbot Coming Soon...</li>
    <p>Water quality assesment is a crucial issue in the fields of public health and environmental science. Knowing the
      contaminant and chemical nature of water found in wells, springs, streams, rivers, and other bodies of water is
      key in determining the potability of water.
      <br> <br>
      To tackle this problem, I decided to pursue a project that can answer questions like "How safe is the water from
      (insert desired outdoorwater source) to drink?". My program pulls real-time data from the <a
        href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt">United States Geological Survey(USGS)</a> via their REST API. It makes
      a decision using an RBF-based approach based on various measured quantities like pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Turbidity,
      Temperature, and specific conductance to determine the potability of water as a percentage.
      <br> <br>
      I implemented natural language processing(NLP) techniques to allow for natural conversation between the chatbot
      and the user.
      The source code behind my chatbot is implemented in Python and JavaScript.

    <h1>Learning Management System(LMS) for Programming Languages</h1>
    <li>Source Code: <a href="https://github.com/vnagpal25/Waterboys_LMS">GitHub</a></li>
    <li>Web Application Prototype: <a href="lms_project.html">Proto.io</a></li>
    <p>
      In a world where automation and technology are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, having the knowledge of a programming knowledge can be extremely beneficial to further people's career options.
      <br><br>
      For this reason, with a team of peers, I embarked on creating a Learning Management System(LMS) that provides prospective students and teachers alike an interface through which they can learn a new programming language(Python or JavaScript).
      We implemented our command-line based interface for the LMS in Java, using object-oriented principles and following the SCRUM methodology to track our sprint progress.
      <br>
      I was primarily responsible for back-end development; I had to write code for the LMS to seamlessly load and save necessary data regarding grades, classes, and course content in JSON format.
      <br>
      This project was extremely beneficial in teaching me about the Software Development Life Cycle.
