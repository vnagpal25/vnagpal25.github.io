    <h1>Water Quality Assesment Chatbot</h1>

    <p>Water quality assesment is a crucial issue in the fields of public health and environmental science. Knowing the
      contaminant and chemical nature of water found in wells, springs, streams, rivers, and other bodies of water is
      key in determining the potability of water.
      <br> <br>
      To tackle this problem, I decided to pursue a project that can answer questions like "How safe is the water from
      (insert desired outdoorwater source) to drink?". My program pulls real-time data from the <a
        href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt">United States Geological Survey(USGS)</a> via their REST API. It makes
      a decision using an RBF-based approach based on various measured quantities like pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Turbidity,
      Temperature, and specific conductance to determine the potability of water as a percentage.
      <br> <br>
      I implemented natural language processing(NLP) techniques using tools like Rasa, BERT, and NLTK to allow for
      natural conversation between the chatbot
      and the user.
      I also implemented the decision making feature behind my chatbot by training a Support Vector Machine model that
      Classifier that decided if water was potable or not as a confidence from 0 to 1

    <h1>Learning Management System(LMS) for Programming Languages</h1>

    <li>Project Report: <a href="Waterboys_requirements.pdf">Client Requirements</a></li>

    <p>
      In a world where automation and technology are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, having the knowledge of a
      programming knowledge can be extremely beneficial to further people's career options.
      <br><br>
      For this reason, with a team of peers, I embarked on creating a Learning Management System(LMS) that provides
      prospective students and teachers alike an interface through which they can learn a new programming
      language(Python or JavaScript).
      We implemented our command-line based interface for the LMS in Java, using object-oriented principles and
      following the SCRUM methodology to track our sprint progress.
      <br>
      I was primarily responsible for back-end development; I had to write code for the LMS to seamlessly load and save
      necessary data regarding grades, classes, and course content in JSON format.
      <br>
      This project was extremely beneficial in teaching me about the Software Development Life Cycle.

    <li>Web Application: <a href="nerdle/index.html">Nerdle - Wordle Replica</a></li>
    <p>
      I have a fascination for puzzles and solving them, particulary the well known game Wordle by New York Times.
      With this project, I decided to recreate Wordle, and called it "Nerdle" (courtesy of my brother Neil).
      I took it as an opportunity to teach myself the basics of web application development, utilizing
      JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
      I also wrote the game originally as a command-line based interface in Java(I called it Vordle, as my name starts
      with V) to familiarize myself with the game mechanics.
      I utilized data structures like dictionaries, trees, and tries as well as many algorithms to correctly implement
      the game logic.
      <br>
      This project was particularly instrumental in showing me the ropes to Web Development.

    <p>Before the concept of NIL was introduced in NCAA sports, people have always been eager to bet on college football
      teams.
      With a group of fellow peers, we decided to tackle this need in the sports betting community by designing a
      college football fantasy app prototype.
      Through this project, I learned the basics of web development (HTML/CSS) as well as project planning/management
      for computing related applications in the modern world.
